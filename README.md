# Meta-Spark-Shaders
The shader code asset allows you to program your own shaders using SparkSL, Meta Spark's own shading language.
As a superset of GLSL 1.0, SparkSL provides a number of features in addition to the usual data types and functions

A shader is a set of algorithms that determines the appearance of a 3D object's surface. They're particularly useful for applying complex changes to a material. Visual shaders can be used to determine the appearance of an object, instead of applying Meta Spark Studio's built-in shaders through the Inspector.
